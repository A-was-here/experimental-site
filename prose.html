      <h2>Stars</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>People who go ghost-hunting don’t realize they can see thousands of ghosts by looking up at the night sky. (At least when there’s no light pollution.) They’re called stars. Starlight travels gazillions of years to reach our eyes. By the time we see them, many stars have already died. We see an apparition of a being who is no more.</li>
      <li>The birth of a star begins when a bunch of space dust cluster together. What’s in the dust? Hydrogen, mostly. A bit of water. Maybe some methanol. Eventually, so much dust cluster together that particles collapse under their collective gravity. Hydrogen fuzes into helium. This fusion sends an immense energy into the void of space. When this energy reaches our eyes, we call that starshine.</li>
      <li>Big, bright stars look beautiful, but they also burn out quickly. Small stars burn slowly and steadily and win the race</li>
      <li>What happens when a star runs out of hydrogen? The star gets desperate for fuel. It fuses helium into carbon, carbon into oxygen, and so on. With each new element, the energy from fusion grows ever more violent. The dense, bloated giant starts to swell.</li>
      <li>Eventually, a war ensues in this dense environment— a war between energy, who wants to fly away, and gravity, who wants to keep everything inside.</li>
      <li>The final battle is a violent consummation between the two forces. The star collapses, creating an enormous, beautiful, and deadly flash of light known as a “supernova”.</li>
      <li>When the flash fades, something emerges from the ruins. It is a frozen core. A skeleton of the star’s former self.</li>
      <li>For the biggest giants, the story does not end here. Gravity emerges victorious. The smallest fibers of existence crumble. The core collapses infinitely inward. It's like dividing by zero. This is how a black hole is born.</li>
      <li>You thought your toddler and/or teenager’s stomach was a bottomless pit? Then you haven’t met a black hole. That beast is never satisfied. Nothing is safe. Not even light.</li>
      <li>To the nerds reading this: Yes, I know some things weren’t 100% accurate. I wanted to make it dramatic, okay?</li>
